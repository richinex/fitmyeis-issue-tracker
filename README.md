# FitMyEIS Issue Tracker

This repository serves as the primary issue tracking system for the FitMyEIS Web Application.

## Introduction

This issue tracker is separate from the primary codebase to streamline issue management and segregate permissions. Here, users can report bugs, propose new features, and discuss ongoing issues related to the FitMyEIS web app.

The main codebase of the FitMyEIS web application is hosted in a separate private repository.

## How to Submit an Issue

1. Navigate to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/richinex/fitmyeis-issue-tracker/issues).
2. Click on `New issue`.
3. Fill in the appropriate title and description for the issue you're facing.
4. If applicable, label the issue as a bug report, feature request, or other appropriate category using the `Labels` option on the right.
5. Click `Submit new issue`.

## Issue Etiquette

Please follow these guidelines when creating issues:

- Do a quick search to see if the issue has already been reported. If it has, add any additional comments to the existing issue rather than creating a new one.
- Write clear, concise, and descriptive titles.
- Include as much detail as possible in your descriptions. Screenshots, logs, and steps to reproduce the issue are very helpful.

## Access

Access to this repository and the main codebase repository is managed by the repository owner. Please contact the owner if you need permission to either repository.
